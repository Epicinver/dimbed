# Dimbed
Discord embed builder.


# How to use Dimbed

Install your preferred version of Dimbed, then open it up; choose either the Windows Forms or Python version. 
-
Select one of the three options available:
-
1. Bot: Requires a bot token and adds a command to the bot to send the embed, provided the bot is online.
2. Webhook: Requests a webhook URL and immediately sends the embed to the designated channel.
3. Clipboard: Experimental feature that copies the embed to your clipboard for use anywhere.
-
# How do I export embeds?
Build your embeds and click "Export Script." Keep in mind the required modules:
-
- Discord.py if you're using a Bot.
- Requests if you're using a Webhook.
(Note: Modules are only needed for the Python version.)
-
Exported scripts will be saved in the same directory as the tool. For example:
-
If the tool is stored in Program Files, the script will be saved to C:\Program Files\Dimbed\exported_mm_dd_yy_hh_mm_ss_ms.py.
If stored in your C:\ drive [not recommended], it will be saved as C:\exported_mm_dd_yy_hh_mm_ss_ms.py.
-

# How to delete Dimbed

If you used the installer, simply go to Windows, search for "Dimbed," and click Uninstall.
-

If you downloaded the script/non-installer version (coming soon), just delete all of Dimbed's files.
