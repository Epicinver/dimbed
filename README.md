# Dimbed
Discord embed builder.


# How to use Dimbed

Install your preffered version of Dimbed then open up your preferred version; Windows Forms OR Python version.
-
Choose the option you'd like, there are three.
-
Here are the options:
Bot; Asks for a bot token and adds a command to the bot which will send the embed IF the bot is online.
Webhook; Asks for a webhook URL and sends the embed immediately in whatever channel it is set to send requests to.
Clipboard; Experimental, will copy the embed to your clipboard so you can send it anywhere.
-
# How do i export embeds?
Build your embeds and click "Export Script".
Just note that you will need the following modules:
-
Discord.py IF your using a Bot.
-
Requests IF your using a Webhook.
-
Exported scripts will save to the directory of which the tool is stored.
For example:
-
If you store the tool in Program Files, it will be stored in C:\Program Files\Dimbed\exported_mm_dd_yy_hh_mm_ss_ms.py
If you store the tool in your C:\ drive [please don't do that], it'll be C:\exported_mm_dd_yy_hh_mm_ss_ms.py 
-

# How to delete Dimbed

If you downloaded the installer, just click Windows, type in "Dimbed" and click Uninstall.
-

If you downloaded the script/non-installer (coming soon... hopefully), then just delete all of Dimbed's files.
